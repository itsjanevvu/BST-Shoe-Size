**Project Description**
I learned all about Binary Search Trees and Linked Lists! In this project, I classified the class of SYDE 27's Shoe sizes using a BST Linked List. I created assorted functions that removed duplicates in the BST, sorted the BST inorder and also to insert new shoe sizes!

**How I did it**
I used OOP principles to create a Node structure of a Shoe with attributes that stores the shoe size, key index, and the names of the people who have the same shoe size.
